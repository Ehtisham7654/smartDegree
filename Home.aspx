                    <h4>Degrees</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        After completion of 2nd Year Many students at initial level found
                        difficulty to select future degree based on their interest and skills.
                        And some of them even don’t know what they like? Or where his interest lay?
                        In many parts of our country students cannot make choice because of several
                        reasons. To illustrate, sometimes people may not be in their own region and 
                        due to this fact, they cannot continue their education based on their interests

                    <h4>Universities</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        One more problem that student face after completing 2nd year is about 
                        choosing the suitable university based on their degree scope, location,
                        fee structure. Its a big problem for students as if they know exactly Know 
                        about their degrees then suitable university make some hurdles and if they 
                        are clear about universities then their fee structures or ranking create a 
                        confusion in his mind about choosing the most optimal unversity.

                    <h4>Find Interest</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">
                        One of the major issue while choosing a degree occurs when student don't know
                        about his interest. Which Degree is best suited according to his skills and which 
                        subjects he would love to study. So there might be a possibilty of choosing wrong 
                        degree if he didn't explore his interest.

                        don't have proper guidance for that. Thats why they got eliminated in i initial
                        rounds and couldn't get into that.
